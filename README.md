UICare is designed to embed wellness-centric components into web projects, focusing on accessibility and user comfort. By incorporating features like customizable reality filters and trauma-informed interactions, UICare aims to support neurodivergent users effectively.

## Features

* **Reality Filters**: Allow users to switch between different visual modes (e.g., default, ninja vision, protocol view) to suit their preferences.

* **Ninja Presence**: A subtle, animated indicator that provides gentle visual feedback without causing distractions.

* **Trauma-Informed Interactions**: Components designed with sensitivity to potential triggers, ensuring a safe user experience.
